        <p>Never quite on time <br>
          Running late, running wild <br>
          Looking up star signs <br>
          Eating apples on the train <br>
          I know you say it's alright <br>
          As you keep it inside <br>
          Hey, when did you realize <br>
          There's no guy with a first prize <br>
          Waiting at the end?</p> </figure>
          
         <figure>
          <p> Cellophane <br>
          You shake, you never change <br>
          Cellophane <br>
          You're strange up in your brain <br>
          Are you afraid <br>
          To stop and find the reason <br>
          Why you can't get away from it? <br></p></figure>
          
         <figure>
          <p> Moving up the coastline <br>
          Making deals, selling houses <br>
          Promise of the good life <br>
          Compliance teams, bleak routines <br>
          Nothing more sad than a man who cries <br>
          In his car in the driveway <br>
          Blue helium light blinking again <br></p></figure>

          Holding off the rain <br>
          I think you're a silk white kite <br>
          Blowing off course again <br>
